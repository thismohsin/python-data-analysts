Description
the product has been very good i had used this cell phone in one of my projects and it worked wonders i will definitely recommend this to anyone interested in buying it
i highly doubt this phone is a genuine nokia product the battery door does not fit properly the battery fits but the plastic guard on the side opposite the contacts is separated once inserting the battery due to poor fit this is not nokia quality your used to it must be some sort of a clone packaging looks authentic albeit generic totally disappointed by this purchase
