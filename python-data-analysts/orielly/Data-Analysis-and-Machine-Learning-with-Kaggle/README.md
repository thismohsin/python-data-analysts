## Book Description
Millions of data enthusiasts from around the world compete on Kaggle, the most famous data science competition platform of them all. Participating in Kaggle competitions is a surefire way to improve your data analysis skills, network with the rest of the community, and gain valuable experience to help grow your career.

The first book of its kind, Data Analysis and Machine Learning with Kaggle assembles the techniques and skills you’ll need for success in competitions, data science projects, and beyond. Two masters of Kaggle walk you through modeling strategies you won’t easily find elsewhere, and the tacit knowledge they’ve accumulated along the way. As well as Kaggle-specific tips, you’ll learn more general techniques for approaching tasks based on image data, tabular data, textual data, and reinforcement learning. You’ll design better validation schemes and work more comfortably with different evaluation metrics.

Whether you want to climb the ranks of Kaggle, build some more data science skills, or improve the accuracy of your existing models, this book is for you.

## What you will learn
* Get acquainted with Kaggle and other competition platforms
* Make the most of Kaggle Notebooks, Datasets, and Discussion forums
* Understand different modeling tasks including binary and multi-class classification, object detection, NLP (Natural Language Processing), and time series
* Design good validation schemes, learning about k-fold, probabilistic, and adversarial validation
* Get to grips with evaluation metrics including MSE and its variants, precision and recall, IoU, mean average precision at k, as well as never-before-seen metrics
* Handle simulation and optimization competitions on Kaggle
* Create a portfolio of projects and ideas to get further in your career
