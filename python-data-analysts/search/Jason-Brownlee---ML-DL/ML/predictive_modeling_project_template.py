# Python Project Template


# 1. Prepare Problem
# a) Load libraries
# b) Load dataset (reduce dataset if necessary, model should build in ~30 sec.. always can scale up later)

# 2. Summarize Data
# a) Descriptive statistics (summaries)
# b) Data visualizations

# 3. Prepare Data (start simple, revisit and cycle with next step until algorithm and presentation of data is accurate enough)
# a) Data Cleaning (remove duplicates, mark/impute missing values)
# b) Feature Selection (remove redundant features, develop new features)
# c) Data Transforms (scale/redistribute attributes to best expose structure of problem)

# 4. Evaluate Algorithms
# a) Split-out validation dataset
# b) Test options and evaluation metric (cross validation and evaluation metric)
# c) Spot-Check Algorithms
# d) Compare Algorithms

# 5. Improve Accuracy
# a) Algorithm Tuning (search for a combination of parameters for each alg that yields the best results)
# b) Ensembles (combine prediction of multiple models into an ensemble prediction)

# 6. Finalize Model
# a) Predictions on validation dataset
# b) Create standalone model on entire training dataset
# c) Save model for later use

# Tips
# 1. Fast First pass: go through project as fast as possible. this will give confidence that all the parts are there and a baseline to improve on
# 2. Cycles: loop through 3-4, 3-4-5
# 3. Attempt every step
# 4. Ratchet Accuracy: treat changes as experiements with goal to increase accuracy
# 5. Adapt as Needed: blur edges of tasks such as 4-5 to beset serve model accuracy
